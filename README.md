### Marcus Otterstad
A 21-year-old software developer from Oslo, Norway. Currently, I'm working on developing three main projects:

#### Strimo
A browser-based streaming platform designed to make live broadcasting accessible and user-friendly. I'm working on this project alongside two brilliant co-developers. Together, we're leveraging WebRTC to provide stable, high-quality streams, aiming to reduce the complexities and costs associated with live streaming. Our vision with Strimo is to enable individuals and organizations to broadcast live events with professional-grade quality using simple equipment, such as smartphones.

#### Personal Dashboard
A personal project of mine, the Personal Dashboard is a web-based application aimed at organizing my life by integrating with Google services. This dashboard keeps all my essential information in one place, offering a streamlined way to manage my daily tasks, appointments, calendar events, workouts while providing valuable insight for optimizing my own habits through data analysis.

#### Algorithmic Trading Application
In collaboration with my dad, who has over 25 years of trading experience, we are maintaining an algorithmic trading system. This project is a perfect blend of our shared interest in trading and software development. We focus on implementing strategies like short term mean reversion and long term trend following systems.
